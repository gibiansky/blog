      "In this notebook, we'll look at finger trees, a general purpose functional data structure developed in the [paper by Hinze and Patterson](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html). Finger trees provide a functional sequence data structure, which provides amortized constant-time access and appending to the front and end of the sequence, as well as logarithmic time concatenation and random access. In addition to good asymptotic runtime bounds, the data structure turns out to be incredibly flexible: when combined with monoidal tags on the elements, finger trees may be used to implement efficient random-access sequences, ordered sequences, interval trees, and priority queues.\n",

      "\n",
      "The basis and motivation for finger trees comes from 2-3 trees. 2-3 trees are trees which can have two or three branches at each internal node and which have all of their leaves at the same level. While a binary tree of uniform depth $d$ must have $2^d$ leaves, 2-3 trees are much more flexible, and may be used to store any number of elements (the number does not have to be a power of two).\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following 2-3 tree (image taken from the original finger-tree paper linked above):\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"/blog/haskell/finger-trees/files/finger-tree-1.png\" width=\"800px\"/>\n",
      "\n",
      "This tree stores fourteen elements. Access to any of them requires three steps, and if we were to add more elements, the number of steps for each one would grow logarithmically. We would like to use these trees in order to model sequences. However, in many application sequences are very often accessed repeatedly at the front or back, and much less often in the middle. To accomodate this use case, we can modify this data structure to prioritize front and back access over other features. \n",
      "\n",
      "In our case, we add two *fingers*. A *finger* is simply a point at which you can access part of a data structure; in imperative languages, this would simply be a pointer. In our case, though, we restructure the entire tree and make the *parents* of the first and last children the two roots of our tree. Visually, consider taking the tree above, grabbing the first and last nodes on the previous-to-last layer, and pulling them up, letting the rest of the tree hang down:\n",

      "\n",
      "<img src=\"/blog/haskell/finger-trees/files/finger-tree-3.png\" width=\"600px\"/>\n",
      "\n",
      "Each layer of the finger tree has a prefix (on the left) and a suffix (on the right), as well as a link further down the spine. The prefix and suffix contain values in the finger tree \u2013 on the first level, they contain values (2-3 trees of depth 0); on the second level, they contain 2-3 trees of depth 1; on the third level, they contain 2-3 trees of depth 2, and so on. This somewhat unusual property comes from the fact that the original 2-3 tree was of uniform depth. The edges of the original 2-3 tree are now at the top of the spine. The root of the 2-3 tree is now the very bottom element of the spine. As we go down the spine, we are traversing from the leaves to the root of the original 2-3 tree; as we go closer to the root, the prefix and suffixes contain deeper and deeper subtrees of the original 2-3 tree.\n",

The recursive case (where the affix has length four) is the problematic one. However, when we encounter an affix of length four and want to add to it, we immediately rebalance the tree such that the affix has length two. Thus, we know *for sure* that the next operation that wants to add an element to that affix can do so immediately in constant time, and will *not* need to descend another level. From this we can deduce that no more than half the operations could possibly need to recurse down into the second layer of the finger tree; for each operation that *does* recurse, there must be *at least* one operation that doesn't. Since the same logic applies to the finger tree at the second layer, we know that only one *quarter* of operations could possibly go down to the third layer. Continuing with the same logic, the $n$th layer of the finger tree could only be visited by one out of every $2^{n-1}$ operations. Thus, the total time $T$ for all $m$ of the append or prepend operations is *at worst* going to be\n",
      "\n",
      "$$T = m + \\frac{1}{2}m + \\frac{1}{4}m + \\frac{1}{8}m + \\cdots,$$\n",
      "\n",
      "because $m$ operations do something at the first level of the tree, $\\frac{1}{2}m$ operations do something at the second level of the tree, and so on. However, *even* if we assume there are an infinite number of layers (and clearly there are less), this series of terms sums to $2m$ (which you can compute using the formula for the sum of a geometric series). Thus, we take $O(m)$ time for $m$ operations, so while the worst case for a single operations is $O(\\lg n)$ with $n$ elements in the tree, the amortized time for this use case is just $O(1)$ for each prepend or append."

      "While it's clear that this code is functional (no pun intended), it's not clear that we've actually done any better in terms of asymptotic runtime guarantees. If we look at the base case for `concatWithMiddle`, we're still doing a ton of prepends! Since every time we recurse down another layer, we add elements to the middle list (from the unused affixes), is it possible that we still have something like $O(m)$ prepends done in the base cases?\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly enough, the answer to this is **no**. We can prove that the base cases *still* take only $O(1)$ amortized time. The magic here lies in our use of `nodes`. As we showed when we defined `nodes`, `nodes` is *guaranteed* to output a list no more than half the length of the input list. Using this property, we can easily track the maximum length that the middle list can be at any point in the computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the computation starts, we know that the middle list has length zero, since we pass `concatWithMiddle` an empty list in our definition of `><`. At each step, we add two affixes (a suffix and a prefix) to the middle list before applying `nodes` to it. We know that the affixes have no more than four elements, so we are adding *at most* eight elements to the middle list. As a result, after we apply `nodes`, our list can have no more than eight elements, because as we add more and more elements, the length of the output of `nodes` can get closer and closer to eight; however, it *cannot* go above eight, because if we start out with less than or equal to eight elements, add eight elements, then divide the length by two, we will end up with less than or equal to eight elements again. To convince yourself, you can trace through an example execution in which you start with zero elements and add eight at each recursive step:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Step 0: Middle list has 0 elements. \n",
      "- Step 1: Add 8 elements (4 from suffix, 4 from prefix). `nodes` reduces the length by half, so middle list now has 4 elements.\n",
      "- Step 2: Add 8 elements, for a total of 12; `nodes` reduces length to 6.\n",
      "- Step 3: Add 8 elements, for a total of 14; `nodes` reduces length to 7.\n",
      "- Step 4: Add 8 elements, for a total of 15; `nodes` reduces length to 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note how the last two steps both yielded a list of the same size \u2013 once the computation reaches that point, the middle list will not become any longer as the recursion continues. Thus, the length of the middle list is bounded by seven, which is $O(1)$ (a constant); as a result, we can confidently say that all of the base cases are also $O(1)$ amortized running time, because they do no more than eight prepends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the base cases are all constant time, the main contributor to the runtime of our `><` is the recursion. At each recursive step, we look at the deeper tree in both the left and right trees passed to `concatWithMiddle`; we reach a base case as soon as one of these trees is not created with the `Deeper` constructor. The depth of these trees grows logarithmically with the number of elements in them; if the finger tree has $n$ elements, it's depth is $O(\\lg n)$. Since our runtime is proportional to the *minimum* depth of either tree, our asympotic runtime bounds are $O(\\min(\\lg n, \\lg m)) = O(\\lg(\\min(m, n)))$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of elements in the left and right trees, respectively."

The second property is true by virtue of the fact that the priority we're searching for, `p`, is known to be the maximum priority that exists in the tree; thus, no matter how many elements we add to the monoidal sum, we know the result will just be `Priority p`, because the monoidal sum picks out the largest priority (which we know is `p`).\n",

      "Finger trees, as described by [Hinze and Patterson](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html), are a pretty awesome data structure. They provide amortized constant time append and prepend (assuming a use case of repeated appends and prepends), amortized constant time left and right views, and logarithmic time concatenation. They can be parameterized by a monoidal annotation; then, given a monotonic boolean predicate on the monoidal annotations, a search can be performed in logarithmic time to determine which element (if any) tipped the scales and caused the incremental monoidal sum along the sequence to pass the predicate. This very general search algorithm allows very high code reuse \u2013 by changing the type stored by the finger tree and adding two typeclass instances, finger trees can be used as very different data structures. In this guide, we used finger trees to implement random-access functional sequences and priority queues with `push` and `pop`. In the original paper, they also describe several other data structures and operations, including ordered sequences (with access and insert) and interval trees. Due to the efficiency and asymptotic guarantees provided by finger trees, they are the basis for the sequences provided in the Haskell base library under the `Data.Sequence` module.\n",
