[IPython](http://ipython.org/), as many of you may already know, is a set of
frontends to the Python language and ecosystem which provides powerful
interactive shells, inline data visualization, support for GUI toolkits, as well
as a beautiful browser-based notebook interface and a number of other nifty
features. In particular, I've found that the
[notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) interface with its inline
documentation and easy re-evaluation is incredibly helpful for development and
debugging. As I started working more and more with Haskell, I began to miss the
notebook interface. Luckily, IPython was designed from the start to be
polymorphic in the language being used: it specifies a protocol and requires a
language interpreting backend (which it calls a "kernel") which speaks that
protocol. So, I set about creating a language kernel for Haskell, which I have
creatively dubbed [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell). Along the
way, I found that the documentation for how I should go about creating this
backend was rather sparse, so in this blog post I'd like to rectify that.

Before continuing, I'd like to reiterate that this is all regurgitating
information found elsewhere on the internet in a hopefully useful manner. You
may find the [complete IPython messaging protocol](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html)
and this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16240747/sending-messages-from-other-languages-to-an-ipython-kernel)
useful as well.


IPython Architecture
===

IPython is designed for a very flexible configuration. Not only do the frontend
and language kernel communicate entirely asynchronously, but the design allows
for multiple frontends talking to the same kernel. Although with the advent of
the multi-user notebook this may become a reality, in my own use I have
always had a single frontend interacting with a single kernel, so I will stick
to that for now. Note that making a kernel work with multiple frontends does
require more work than just a single frontend, and the details are all in the
complete messaging spec (see above). That said, we can picture the basic IPython
communication system as follows:

![Simplified IPython Architecture](images/ipython.png)

I'm going to refer to these quite often, so keep this diagram handy. 

IPython communicates with its kernel backends using the
[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) networking and concurrency library. Luckily,
bindings to ZeroMQ exist for most languages, so using it should cause no
trouble. 

ZeroMQ
---
ZeroMQ allows you to establish generalized sockets for communication.
Although the word 'socket' usually connotes networking, ZeroMQ sockets are
slightly more general and are used as a communication and concurrency primitive.
When creating the socket, it can be declared as a TCP, UDP, or even in-process
socket which does not do any networking.

In addition to the method of transportation (TCP, UDP, IPC, and so on), each
socket has a type which indicates how the socket communicates and what type of
sockets it can communicate with. Although ZeroMQ defines a number of socket
types in order to support very distributed and fault tolerant applications, the
ones we are interested in are as follows:

- **REP**: The only thing this socket does is receive requests and then reply to
  them.
- **REQ**: This socket is the opposite of **REP** - it sends requests and reads
  replies to them.
- **PUB**: This socket broadcasts (publishes) information to anyone who is listening.
- **SUB**: This socket subscribes to a **PUB** socket and listens to all its
  broadcasts.
- **ROUTER**: This socket can be used as a multi-user **REP** socket. It can
  receive requests from many other sockets and reply to all of them. **ROUTER**
  sockets store the identity of the source of the message before sending the
  message to the application, and the application receives messages from all
  origins. When replying to a message, the **ROUTER** socket will send the reply
  to the origin of the request.
- **DEALER**: This socket allows round-robin communication between sets of
  sockets. If a message is sent to a **DEALER**, the **DEALER** will send to all
  connected peers. This allows sets of sockets to communicate without explicit
  knowledge of all the sockets in the set.

Kernel Sockets
--- 

Although ZeroMQ is capable of much more, we are interested only in the sockets
that we'll need for communicating with the IPython frontend. The backend should
have the following ZeroMQ sockets:

- **Heartbeat**: This is a *REP* socket which simply echoes anything its given.
  IPython uses this to check up on the kernel - if the heartbeat port does not
  respond within a few seconds, IPython assumes the kernel is dead and restarts
  it (or exits with an error).
- **Shell**, **Control**: These two *ROUTER* sockets - which, as far as I can tell, are
  identical for the purpose of single frontend use - are what IPython uses to
  query the language backend. Requests for code evaluation, object inspection,
  and so on are sent through these sockets, and each request must have a
  corresponding reply.  
- **Stdin**: This *ROUTER* socket is a socket which the language backend can use
  to query the frontend for input. For instance, in Python, when `raw_input()`
  is used, the Python language backend requests input from the frontend.
- **IOPub**: This *PUB* socket is used to publish all code output. When a block
  of code finishes (or partially finishes) running, messages are sent to all
  subscribed frontends via this socket, so they can display the output. All
  output is sent via this mechanism - the reply messages on the **Shell**
  messages are very simple and only indicate success and failure.

Configuring IPython
---

We've now covered all the fundamental ideas behind the IPython communication
framework, but before diving in to the messaging details, let's go over getting
IPython set up to talk to your kernel. A language kernel should define its own
IPython profile. When started with this profile, IPython will know to
communicate with the particular language kernel instead of defaulting to the
Python backend. In addition, other language-specific configuration (such as
initialization, extensions, etc) can be added to this profile. You can create
the profile via the shell commands

```bash
# Create the profile.
ipython profile create language-name

# Start IPython with the profile.
ipython console --profile language-name
```

Once you've created the profile, you can edit the profile configuration to set
the kernel. This will be located in your IPython configuration directory, which
is going to be `~/.config/ipython` or `~/.ipython`, depending on your operating
system. You will likely want to edit `profile_language-name/ipython-config.py`.
In order to set the language kernel, use the following code:

```python
# Set the kernel command.
c = get_config()
c.KernelManager.kernel_cmd = ["/path/to/executable/kernel_exe",
                              "{connection_file}"]            

# Disable authentication.
c.Session.key = b''
c.Session.keyfile = b''                                
```

With this configuration, your kernel will be called with a single command line
parameter. This command line parameter will be a JSON file that looks like
this:

```javascript
{
    "stdin_port": 48691,
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "control_port": 44808, 
    "hb_port": 49691, 
    "signature_scheme": "hmac-sha256", 
    "key": "", 
    "shell_port": 40544, 
    "transport": "tcp", 
    "iopub_port": 43462
}
```

This scheme defines the ports, IP, transport mechanism, and authentication
mechanism that the kernel should use for communicating with the frontend. The
kernel should then create sockets for each of those ports and bind them to the
appropriate locations. (Note 'bind', as opposed to 'connect' - in ZeroMQ, 
[there's a difference](http://zeromq.org/area:faq#toc5).)


Reading Messages
---

Once IPython is attempting to connect to your kernel and you have sockets
listening to the correct ports, you can begin parsing and replying to the
messages IPython sends your kernel. There are one to two dozen different
messages which are all described in the [Messaging Protocol](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html).
However, only some of them need to be implemented for a useful kernel. 

Each message (except for those on the heartbeat port) is serialized as a stream
of binary blobs. Quoting the messaging protocol:

```python
[
    b'u-u-i-d',         # Zmq identity(ies)
    b'<IDS|MSG>',       # delimiter
    b'baddad42',        # HMAC signature
    b'{header}',        # Serialized header dict
    b'{parent_header}', # Serialized parent header dict
    b'{metadata}',      # Serialized metadata dict
    b'{content}',       # Serialized content dict
    b'blob',            # extra raw data buffer(s)
    ...
]
```
The dictionaries are simply serialized JSON, and can be read as such.

If you are reading directly from ZeroMQ sockets, there are several small things
to note:

- In order to read the ZeroMQ identities, read all the blobs until the
  identifier delimiter, "\<IDS|MSG\>". This will be in several messages if there
  are several ZeroMQ identities involved, but most of the time this will be a
  single [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuid) followed by a "\<IDS|MSG\>"
  message.
- The UUIDs are often used for comparison. For instance, the parent header UUID
  may be used by IPython to determine which message or which notebook is being
  replied to. However, IPython uses direct *string comparison* for UUID
  comparison, so "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479" and
  "F47AC10B58CC4372A5670E02B2C3D479" will be different, although they represent
  the same UUID. In addition, IPython console and IPython notebook will use
  differently formatted UUIDs (console uses the former version, while notebook
  uses the capitalized latter version). Anyway, be careful to always return the
  same UUID in the parent that you get in the request - parsing the UUID and
  later converting it back to a string may not work with all IPython frontends.

Important Messages
---

For a basic language kernel, you must respond to two message types. The first of
these is `"kernel_info_request"`. A `kernel_info_request` message has no
content, but indicates that a `"kernel_info_reply"` message should be sent back.
The `kernel_info_reply` message will contain information about the kernel, such
as the IPython version expected, the protocol version, the language, and so on.
This message *must* be sent before the IPython frontend finishes its
initialization, and full detail about what should go into these messages can be
found [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#kernel-info).

The second and most important message type is `"execute_request"`. An
`execute_request` messages indicates a request to evaluate a block of code. Note
that this is not necessarily a single *line* of code - although the console will
only send a single line, notebook interfaces may send significantly more. The
full content of the message is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#execute).

An `"execute_reply"` message must eventually be sent in reply to the
`execute_request`. The only two fields are the execution counter (so that the
frontend knows which `execute_request` is being replied to) and the status of
the execution, which is either `"ok"`, `"error"`, or `"abort"`. The
`execute_reply` indicates that the processing of the source code has been
completed and that it has been executed.

Note that the `execute_reply` message *doesn't* contain any information about
the code that was just run! All information about the code and its output is
sent in separate messages on the IOPub port.

Publishing Output
---

When your language kernel receives an `execute_request`, it needs to send back
an `execute_reply` as well as several messages on the IOPub port. 

Before beginning the execution of the code, send a [status update](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#kernel-status)
to the frontend declaring that the kernel is busy. This `status` message informs
the frontend that the kernel is currently busy, so that it can potentially
display that information to the user.  Similarly, when code is done executing,
you should send another status update, this time informing the frontend that the
kernel is now idle.

During code execution, there are two types of data your kernel may want to send
to the frontend. The [display data message](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#display-data)
message, `display_data`, allows you to publish multiple representations of your
data. For instance, if your code outputs a table, it may do so simultaneously as
printed monospace code, HTML, Latex, or even a PNG or SVG containing an image of
the table. The kernel will then decide the optimal way to display your data,
which can lead to beatiful presentations in the IPython notebook.

However, you will likely also want to publish raw output, such as the output
from `print` statements or their equivalent. Although you could do
this in the `display_data` messages, you should instead use the simpler output
message `pyout`. The [Python output](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#python-outputs)
message indicates that this is the raw output data and *not* just a
representation of some data, and this output data is generally presented
differently in IPython frontends.

Further Development
---

This describes a very basic IPython language kernel. However, there are many
other messages required for full capability - things such as object
introspection, looking up documentation, and so on. You can figure these out by
thoroughly reading the messaging protocol.

If you'd like to read a reference implementation in Haskell, I urge you to look
at (and, if you'd like to, contribute to) the development of [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) - an
IPython kernel for Haskell.
