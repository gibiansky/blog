It has an input layer for $x_i$, an output layer for $y_i$, and another input layer for the previous hidden state $h_{i-1}$. Finally, it has one hidden layer between these. The only unusual thing is that we have two input layers; both of the input layers are are connected to the hidden layer as if they were really just a single layer.\n",

Since this backpropagation algorithm works on sequences in time, it is known as *backpropagation through time*. We can derive it in the same way we did before - define an error metric and then take partial derivatives of the error with respect to the weights. Alternatively, we can also just base our algorithm off the normal backpropagation algorithm by expanding the neural network in time.\n",

    "However, even with this second order approximation, problems can arise. If conjugate gradient strays too far from the original $x$, the curvature estimate $G$ becomes innacurate, and may lead to worse convergence (or even steps in the wrong direction). In order to combat this problem, Martens suggests a method of *structural damping*.\n",

Since the scale of $G$ may change, a constant $\\lambda$ is inappropriate, as it may be too big (in which case it would override the second order elements of $G$) or too small (in which case it wouldn't matter). Instead, Marten's recommends a Levenberg-Marquardt style heuristic (named after the heuristics used in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which uses a similar damping parameter). The heuristic starts with $\\lambda = \\lambda_0$ (for some previously chosen $\\lambda_0$) and at each step scales $\\lambda$ either up or down to match the scale of $G$. \n",

If the reduction ratio is low ($\\rho < \\frac{1}{4}$), do *not* move to $x+\\Delta x$, but instead increase $\\lambda$ by multiplication by $\\frac{3}{2}$, and try again.

    "In recurrent networks, the weight matrices are used at every time step, meaning that the same matrix is used many many times in different places. As a result, a very small perturbation to this matrix can result in a *very* large different output difference. This yields the intuition that in addition to penalizing the size of the deviation via $\\lambda \\Delta x^T \\Delta x$, we should also penalize causing a large deviation in the hidden state via some $\\mu S_x(\\Delta x)$.\n",

    "Now that we have established our structural damping as a modification to our quadratic object, we must figure out how to compute the structural damping penalty. In order to do so, we simply add an output to our recurrent neural network: in addition to outputting $\\hat y_i$ at each time step, the neural network also outputs the current value at the hidden layer, namely $h_i$. Then, we can include our structural damping simply by including an error term for every $h_i$ in the final error, where the error for $h_i$ at the candidate point $x + \\Delta x$ is the distance $D(h_i(x), h_i(x + \\Delta x))$. It turns out that including this extra error term is fairly simple, and only requires computing the Hessian of $D \\circ \\sigma$, and that everything else is already done anyways (as it is needed for the Gauss-Newton matrix-vector product for the normal outputs). In the [original paper](http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/ICML2011Martens_532.pdf), Martens and Sutskever work through this slightly more rigorously and provide specific algorithms that result from these techniques for different activation and erro functions.\n",
