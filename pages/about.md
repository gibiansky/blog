title: About Me
---

I am currently a student at Harvey Mudd College studying mathematics and
computational everything.  I have an extensive background in computer science,
and I get excited about machine learning, data analysis, mathematical
modeling and simulation, as well as electrical and digital engineering. I keep
a [sparsely-updated blog](http://andrew.gibiansky.com) about things I enjoy. My
resumé is available upon request, and my contact info is on the right.
